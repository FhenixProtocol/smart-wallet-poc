# Fhenix Smart Wallet POC

url: https://smart-wallet-poc-nine.vercel.app/

View your confidential balances using an alchemy LightAccount smart wallet. Built using the new Fhenix Permit V2 system (not provided by fhenix.js) on top of scaffold-eth.

! NOTE: The mock tokens are deployed on Sepolia, and don't use FHE operations for the encrypted data. This will be fixed when the alchemy account-kit contracts have been deployed on Fhenix Nitrogen. See [FHERC20.sol](packages/hardhat/contracts/FHERC20.sol) for more.

! NOTE: Logging in with an EOA does not work, the existing rainbowkit connection logic has been removed, only smart wallets will work.

Defaults that should be changed:

- Arch Alchemy Api Key
- Need a WalletConnect api key
- Add deployed site url to alchemy account kit config
